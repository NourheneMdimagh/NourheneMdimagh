### Hi there 👋
I'm a junior developer, currently working and studying to get my Software engineering degree. 
I am particularly interested in learning more about data engineering and Machine Learning, although I am still a beginner. 
I did some basic to advanced Python projects related to AI and Automation. Likewise, I did work on some web-related projects.
I would describe myself as "persistent", "creative" and "flexible".

I'm currently learning more about Docker and Kubernetes.
